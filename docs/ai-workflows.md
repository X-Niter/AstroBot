# AI-Powered GitHub Workflows

AstroBot uses AI-powered GitHub workflows to automate development tasks, including error detection and automatic fixes. This guide explains how these workflows function and how to use them effectively.

## Available AI Workflows

### 1. AI Issue Processor

This workflow automatically analyzes issues when they're created or labeled, and can suggest or implement fixes.

**Key capabilities:**
- Analyzes error logs and stack traces in issues
- Suggests code fixes with explanations
- Can automatically create pull requests with fixes
- Assigns appropriate labels and priorities

### 2. AI Comment Handler

This workflow responds to special commands in issue and PR comments to trigger AI actions.

**Available commands:**
- `@ai explain` - Explain a piece of code or an error
- `@ai fix` - Suggest or implement a fix for an issue
- `@ai optimize` - Find performance improvements
- `@ai document` - Generate documentation for code
- `@ai test` - Create test cases

### 3. AI Code Review

This workflow automatically reviews pull requests, providing feedback and suggestions.

**Review focus areas:**
- Code style and best practices
- Potential bugs and security issues
- Performance considerations
- Documentation completeness

### 4. AI Scheduled Maintenance

This workflow runs on a schedule to perform routine maintenance tasks.

**Maintenance tasks:**
- Checking for outdated dependencies
- Identifying and fixing common code anti-patterns
- Ensuring documentation is up-to-date
- Running automated tests and fixing failures

## How It Works

1. GitHub Actions workflows are triggered by events (issue creation, comments, PR submissions, etc.)
2. The workflow uses advanced AI models to analyze code, logs, and context
3. Based on analysis, the AI takes appropriate actions (commenting, creating PRs, etc.)
4. All changes are reviewed by maintainers before being merged

## Example: Fixing Undefined Variable Errors

When the CI pipeline detects errors like `undefined name 'func'`, the AI workflows can:

1. Analyze the error and determine the missing import
2. Create a PR that adds the necessary import statements
3. Run tests to verify the fix works
4. Request review from maintainers

```python
# Before: Missing import
def count_records(guild_id):
    return db.session.query(func.count(Record.id)).filter_by(guild_id=guild_id).scalar() or 0

# After: AI-fixed with proper import
from sqlalchemy import func

def count_records(guild_id):
    return db.session.query(func.count(Record.id)).filter_by(guild_id=guild_id).scalar() or 0
```

## Setting Up Custom AI Workflows

Maintainers can create custom AI workflows for specific needs:

1. Navigate to `.github/workflows/` in the repository
2. Create a new YAML file for your workflow
3. Define triggers, permissions, and steps
4. Configure AI actions and parameters

Example workflow definition:

```yaml
name: AI Error Fixer

on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows: ["CI Tests"]
    types: [completed]
    
jobs:
  fix-errors:
    if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure' }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Get test errors
        run: |
          # Script to extract errors from logs
          
      - name: AI Fix
        uses: ./.github/actions/ai-fix
        with:
          error-log: ${{ steps.extract.outputs.errors }}
          create-pr: true
```

## Best Practices

1. **Review all AI-generated changes** before merging
2. Use `@ai explain` to understand issues before applying fixes
3. Provide detailed context in issue descriptions for better AI analysis
4. Combine AI suggestions with human expertise for optimal results
5. Use AI workflows as assistants, not replacements for human review

## Future Enhancements

The AstroBot team is working on expanding AI capabilities:

- Learning from previous fixes to improve suggestions
- Automated refactoring of complex code
- Proactive identification of potential issues
- Integration with development environments
- Custom fine-tuning for project-specific patterns

By leveraging these AI-powered workflows, the AstroBot project can maintain higher code quality, reduce manual effort, and focus human attention on creative and complex aspects of development.
